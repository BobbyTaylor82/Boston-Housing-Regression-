![png](boston.jpg)

<b>Project Objective:</b> For this repository, I decided to explore the Boston data set using Linear Regression to see how each feature will impact the median housing price. Also, my goal was to obtain a better understanding of different evaluation methods used in regression analysis.


Tools Used: 
<ul>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Jupyter notebook</li>
<li> Python 3</li>
<li> Seaborn </li>
<li> Matplotlib</li> 
<li> sklearn </li> 
</ul>


### The Evaluation and Modeling is located in the Boston Housing Linear Regression.ipynb file.
